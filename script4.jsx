var posts1 = ["admin123", "admin", "2571", "To all members of the HammerCounterForum community:\r\rI, the other admins, and some of the moderators have decided to try something a little unorthodox here. I'm aware that this type of thread is unprecedented in the history of HammerCounterForum, but nonetheless, I feel like a discussion of this sort is called for by these circumstances.\r\rThere has been growing concern in recent months about Erik Naggum's increasingly belligerent behavior on this forum. I am sure that regular members of this forum will not need to be reminded of Erik's past exploits; even within the past few days, he has engaged in several lengthy, charged conversations with prominent members of the community, which many of you witnessed personally. I've taken the liberty of summarizing some the most common complaints about Erik's behavior below. I admit that the wording is entirely my own, and that the following summary should merely be taken to be a composite view of the types of complaints I've gotten from multiple members of the forum, and not as representing the particular opinions of any one poster:\r\rErik is often rude, aggressive, and insulting towards other members of the forum, even during relatively normal conversations. This problem is intensified, however, during any debates or disagreements that Erik engages in. Posters complain that Erik's tone makes it difficult for people to remain calm and rational in the discussions in which Erik is participating.\r\rErik is often discouraging towards new members, taking on a mocking or disparaging tone towards those forum members who he perceives as being less skilled or knowledgeable than himself. We have increasingly received complaints that this has discouraged new members from becoming active members, and in some cases, has even discouraged people from learning more about hammer counting altogether. Erik's comments made them feel like they were not capable of becoming hammer counters, or that they would not be welcome in the community if they did.\r\rHe has advanced a very specific philosophical view about the aims of hammer counting, and a very specific practical view about how those aims are to be achieved; he has personally attacked those who do not share his views, and when challenged, he has been completely recalcitrant, insisting that his views and his alone are correct.\r\rOther members get the idea that acting like Erik is appropriate, bringing the overall quality of discussion down. New users have increasingly reported feeling unwelcome on the forum. Other threads where Erik has not participated are beginning to take on his characteristic tone and format.\r\rIt has gotten to the point where vendors, members of standards committees, and other highly-respected figures within the profession have contacted me personally and informed me that they will no longer be able to participate on HammerCounterForum and contribute their expertise if this is the kind of atmosphere that we intend on cultivating. Clearly, these comments mean a great deal to me; it has been my goal from day one to make HammerCounterForum the premiere resource on the Internet for hammer counting discussions, and that goal will be impossible to achieve if the most valuable resources in our community refuse to share their unique contributions.\r\rIn light of these considerations, many admins and moderators have been in favor of simply banning Erik outright. However, we all understand that there are further nuances to this issue that need to be considered. The value of Erik's contributions to this community are undeniable; he has consistently provided sound advice and wisdom to both veteran and initiate members alike, even though his tone has often been abrasive. Many of us, myself included, feel that Erik has not only given us useful practical advice, but has indeed enhance our conception of hammer counting on a fundamental level; I do not believe I would be the hammer counter I am today without Erik.\r\rTo this end, we would essentially like to open the issue of Erik's potential banning to a community discussion. We invite community members to use this thread to give arguments both pro and con on the topic of Erik being banned. I am not sure how this discussion will develop; I've said my piece, and now I will turn the floor over to others.", "1",
"DanTheMan", "moderator", "1901", "I'm glad that this issue is finally being discussed out in the open. I understand that Erik has been very helpful at certain times during his stay here, and I don't deny that he is an extremely knowledgeable hammer counter. However, I feel that his negative behavior far outweighs the good. He has brought consternation, argumentation and drama to this community, almost from the day he joined. Personally, I would not be sad to see him go.", "2",
"stevenmur", "normal", "155", "I haven't paid much attention to him honestly. I try to avoid the drama threads. When a thread's going on for multiple pages and no one is even talking about the original topic anymore, I just get out and let other people settle it.", "3",
"PXQ8", "normal", "575", "Admin,\r\rOn the one hand, I'm glad we've finally decided to have a frank discussion about this out in the open. Tensions have been simmering for quite some time over the issue, and I think it could work out for the best if all interested parties make their feelings known.\r\rOn the other hand, I think the entire idea of this conversation may be predicated on something troubling. It seems that you wish to ascertain the community's general feelings on Erik, and use this sentiment as a guide in your decision of whether to ban him or not. Fair enough, this all sounds very democratic; but should the question of permanently exiling a member of the community be the sort of thing that is decided democratically?\r\rWhether or not Erik should be banned should be determined by the specific, explicit rules that our community has laid down. He has been argumentative, even aggressive with some members in the past, true, but do we have any rules against that?  Surely many other valued members of this community would have to be banned too, if such behavior were to be censured here. I would prefer the decision of Erik's banning to be left to a senior administrator who is experienced in the interpretation and application of the rules of our community. In that light of that, this current thread should serve as little more than catharsis, and not as a tool to determine policy.", "4",
"admin123", "admin", "2571", "No, we have not ever had any explicit rules about being argumentative. I'm inclined to say that's irrelevant, however. We as a community have the right to decide to take whatever collective action we wish, including banning certain members from our forum if we see fit. In Erik's case, I think his egregious behavior more than warrants a discussion of this sort, and I trust that the consensus opinion of the community will ultimately be made manifest, so that it can guide our decisions. Yes, I believe that the admins and moderators ultimately should be guided by the community consensus, whatever it may be, not only in this case, but in all similar cases as well.", "1",
"stevenmur", "normal", "155", "But this is obviously absurd. Imagine what would happen if we allowed people in real life to take collective action outside the context of legal authority. We would expose people to the possibility of grievous bodily harm merely because the community willed it, and the individual would become subject to the undulating passions of the community.\r\rWe cannot allow every decision to be made by direct democracy; this is why we codify laws. And just as we have a set of codified laws for the nations we inhabit, we have a set of codified laws for this forum as well. There is no need for recourse to an abstract social contract; the rules are laid out in their entirety, and all members must explicitly acknowledge them in order to register on the forum. Since the rules include nothing about respect for one's fellow posters, or the tone in which arguments must be conducted, it is unfair to sanction any member for failing to meet those expectations. I hope that my fellow posters will acknowledge this, so that we will not descend into mob rule.", "3",
"TheLonelyOne", "normal", "392", "Admin, exactly how are you going to conduct this community vote? I'm not sure if a simple poll open to all members is going to be sufficient; new members clearly have a lesser stake in the functioning of the community, and they may not be as familiar with Erik's past transgressions. Are you planning on giving the voices of veteran, trusted members of the community more weight?", "5",
"admin123", "admin", "2571", "I'm still trying to make that decision. For now, I'm going to keep discussion of this issue localized to this thread, and I encourage the most valued members of the community to contribute - as well as Erik himself, of course. It would be inappropriate to not allow the accused to defend himself. Whatever method of consensus-gathering we decide on, the final decision of whether to ban Erik or not will ultimately rest with myself and the other senior admins, but we will of course take community input into consideration.", "1",
"PXQ8", "normal", "575", "Your point is well-taken, but this is an Internet forum, not a real nation of real citizens. Perhaps all this talk of moral obligations is an indication of taking the issue too seriously?  Nothing that happens here can be of any great consequence (in terms of our personal interactions with each other - of course people have been harmed via the Internet, as in the theft of personal information for example), and no action we take against Erik on this forum can constitute any great violation of his rights. Perhaps being banned would even do him some good - he could go outside and get some sunshine for once, instead of spending all of his time harassing and berating the members of this forum. The worst harm that could befall him is that he is isolated from the generous amounts of hammer counting expertise that coalesces on this forum; but there are other resources on the Internet available to him, and as he has made clear anyway, he considers himself intellectually superior to almost all members of this forum, so by his own measure, it will be no great loss for him.\r\rBeing banned from a forum is not equivalent to suffering real violence. Erik's presence here actively harms the community because he discourages new posters from contributing and lowers the overall quality of discussion. If we decide that it would benefit our community greatly, for so little a harm to an individual, then why would we not undertake this simple act? How could a moral obligation be so strong as to override that consideration?", "4",
"37xcalibur", "normal", "125", "I just wanted to contribute to the evolving conversation here. I personally vote against Erik being banned, yes he can be harsh at times, but he's taught me more about hammer counting than anyone else on this forum. His expertise would be sorely missed.", "6"]

var posts2 = ["stevenmur", "normal", "155", "I grant your point that the ethical decisions that we undertake here are not quite so serious, and perhaps this talk of unfailing moral obligations is ultimately nothing more than bluster. Suppose I grant even further your point that nothing that happens on an Internet forum can be of any great consequence, up to and including the expulsion of members; then I would turn this observation on you, and say that none of Erik's behavior has been of any great consequence either, so long as his writings do not literally obscure the technical information available on the forum, which they do not. Why, then, are certain members of the community so passionate about banning him?  Why not simply let him stay and ignore him.\r\rBut I am not convinced that dealings on Internet forums are quite as trivial as you make them out to be. There is a sense in which the conversations we have here reveal something of our character; they show how we are apt to interact with people when there are no repercussions, they let us express our true emotions, through our words and actions. If we cannot hold ourselves to a high moral standard in what you admit to be trivial matters, how can we expect to hold ourselves to a high standard in matters of great importance?  When a community is so eager to censure a person who, as I have repeatedly claimed, has officially violated none of our rules, what does that say about us, our capacity to be angered and provoked, our temperament?\r\rAnd we must not forget that there is a person behind Erik's account, a person behind the keyboard, who undoubtedly will have a certain emotional response to these proceedings. And what of his feelings?  How would being banned make him feel?", "3",

var posts3 = ["Erik", "normal", "672", "My fellow \"hammer counters\".  Yes, I felt that \"scare quotes\" were appropriate there.  It's time that we had a chat.  It's time that I laid out what my expectations for you are, and how you are failing to meet those expectations.  Undoubtedly, a number of questions are already buzzing through your mind, you who are reading this.  Who am I to make demands of you?  Who am I to cast myself in this position of authority?  I believe that will be made clear over the course of this post.  I suggest you read the whole thing; I'm not writing this for my health, but for yours.\r\rLet me first begin by describing the type of world that I want to live in.  I want to live in a world where people are truly passionate about hammer counting; a world where they truly love it.  Well, maybe \"passion\" and \"love\" aren't even the right words.  I want to live in a world where people work themselves up into a *frenzy* over hammer counting, at all times of the day and night; never shall it leave their mind's eye.  I want to live in a world where a number of foul phrases shall never befall a hammer counter's lips:  \"I'm just doing it for the money\", \"this is just a job for me\", \"I just happened to be good at it\".  These are all examples of *poison*: they poison the minds of those who hear them and they poison the souls of those who speak them.  Being an honest, upright, moral man who would never wish for such harms to befall anyone, I of course wish to live in a world without these poisons.\r\rBut unfortunately, that is not the case.  I must now detail how reality falls short of the perfect world I have just described.  For we in fact *do* live in a world where such poisons befoul our streets on a daily basis.  \"It's just a job\", says the hammer counter over here.  \"I'm just doing it for the money\", says the hammer counter over there.  It breaks my heart.  It really does.  It harms me and it harms them.\r\rWhat do these words even *mean*, you might ask?  \"It's just a job\".  Roll the phrase around in your brain, see how it falls on your fingers as you type it on your keyboard.  \"It's just a job\".  I don't know about you, but it burns my fingers to even type it.  There was a time when that sentence would have been unthinkable to any hammer counter, because it was and to this day still is unthinkable to any *real* hammer counter, and there was a time when the *only* hammer counters were real hammer counters.  That's right, I'm calling you out.  Maybe not you, personally, but some of you, on this very forum.  I think you're fakes.  I think you're not real hammer counters.  There's no need for me to demonstrate evidence, you know who you are.\r\rA true hammer counter is driven by a passion that emanates from the very core of his soul.  The sentence \"it's just a job\" is, to him, ungrammatical, nonsensical, disallowed by the rules of the formal system.  A job is the kind of thing that one can acquire or discard, as the circumstances permit.  It is contingent; it is not a necessary aspect of one's nature or identity.  But for the true hammer counter, the situation is precisely the reverse.  He does not take on the role of a hammer counter merely in the context of employment, he simply *is* a hammer counter, full stop.  To selectively excise that part of his identity, his self, would be impossible; it is omnipresent and always active.  To a true hammer counter, paid employment in the field of hammer counting is simply one convenient vehicle of expression for a deep-seated nature that ultimately must express itself in some form or another.\r\rThere is an anecdote I wish to recount, one that I still remember quite distinctly and fondly despite it occurring so many years ago.  There was a friend of mine, a fellow hammer counter - I won't reveal his name, as I haven't asked for his permission to do so, and indeed I wouldn't be surprised if he browses this very forum.  He telephoned me in the middle of the night and awoke me from a deep slumber.  Strangely enough, he said nothing - how am I supposed to know what he wanted if he said nothing?  And yet, I knew.  I immediately dressed myself and rushed over to his house.  Immediately upon crossing the threshold of his home, I was confronted with that mischievous glimmer in his eye, that glimmer that will be familiar to all true hammer counter enthusiasts, and at that moment all of my suspicions were confirmed.  Deviously, he had concealed hammers in various places around his home, quite a different number than usual, and I was to count them.  The game was on.\r\rThis is an example of the type of psychic bond that can form between true hammer counters.  It is something that someone who just does it \"as a job\" could never understand.  I truly pity you, those of you who will never have this kind of experience.  From my first experiences with hammer counting as a child, from working out those first early problems using paper and pencil, I knew that I was destined for these sorts of experiences with hammer counting.  And what about the rest of you?  Is there nothing that stirs your passions?  Is there no profession, no honest way of earning a living, not even a simple hobby that speaks to your own inner self?  If there is no such thing, then I feel truly sorry that you must spend your days walking this earth as a shallow husk.  And if there *is* such a thing, if you *do* understand what lies at the core of your soul, why do you not follow that passion instead?  Why do you insist on continuing to toil at this endeavor for which you clearly have no love?\r\rMost of you will never know my passion.  Most of you will never know the emotions I feel.  Some will, and some do, and I am thankful for the time I have spent interacting with those people on this forum.  But most of you never will.  The only experiences of hammer counting that you ever have are experiences of sloth, timidity, laziness.  \"It is simply too difficult,\" you say, \"having to keep pace with all these new methods and techniques, many of which utilize obscure and abstruse concepts.  I am a simple man with simple wants.  I aim to perform my professional duties well enough, but there is only so much that can be demanded of me.  If here lies the next step, then here is where I throw in the towel.  I'm an honest, practical man, I know when to quit.\"  So you all say.  You never miss an opportunity to abdicate a challenge.\r\rSo what is it, ultimately, that I demand from you all?  Nothing unreasonable, nothing unreasonable at all.  I merely demand that each of you closely examine your true nature, and follow it where it may lead you.  It is clear that most of you are not cut out for hammer counting, and most of you lack even the basic desire to continue doing it.  To those of you I say, be free!  Follow your true heart, your true passion!  The world of hammer counting will thank you for it!  There will be more room for those of us who truly belong here, cleaner air, an easier path to the sunshine.  We will not be troubled by your complaints any longer, we will not have to concern ourselves with working with you.  You will have your place in life and we will have ours.\r\rThis could be considered something of a \"manifesto\", if you will.  A passionate call for a better world and a better world of hammer counting.  Do with it what you will.  Unfortunately, its words will probably be misunderstood by those who most desperately need to hear them.  To others, those who are true hammer counters, I hope this helps you understand me a little better.", "7",

A forlorn, sideways glance of pity, at someone who must toil along in the labor of hammer counting while ultimately lacking true passion for it.  Crucially, the primary emotion I feel is never arrogance, but sorrow.  Sorrow that this is the world we live in, sorrow that this is the world you live in.\r\rPerhaps it might be said that someone in your position, someone of your stature, is ultimately incapable of understanding what I'm saying here?
